Over the years, Java evolved through various versions, with Java 2 (released in 1998) introducing the popular Standard, Enterprise, and Micro Editions.In 2010, Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems, taking over Javas development.</p> <p> Java has become a widely used programming language, particularly for web, mobile, and enterprise applications, with Android development relying heavily on Java. Java is a versatile language supporting both structured and object-oriented programming.</p> <p>Initially designed for embedded systems, it became a general-purpose language, known for its platform independence via the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Structured programming in Java uses modular code with functions, while object-oriented programming focuses on classes and objects to model real-world entities and promote code reuse. Its adaptability makes Java widely used in web, mobile, and enterprise applications.</p>';

It supports key OOP concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.</p> <p>Secure: Java provides a secure runtime environment with features like bytecode verification, security managers, and garbage collection, making it ideal for network-based applications.</p><p>Robust: Java has strong memory management and exception handling, which helps prevent crashes or unexpected behavior. It includes automatic garbage collection to handle memory deallocation.</p> <p>Multithreaded: Java natively supports multithreading, allowing multiple tasks to run concurrently within a single program, improving performance, especially in large-scale applications.</p>';

PUBLIC: The member is accessible from any other class. PROTECTED: The member is accessible within its own package and by subclasses. PRIVATE: The member is accessible only within its own class.</p> <p>2. NON-ACCESS MODIFIERS: Non-access modifiers provide additional functionality and characteristics to classes, methods, and variables. STATIC: Indicates that a member belongs to the class rather than instances of the class. Static members can be accessed without creating an instance of the class. FINAL: Indicates that a variable’s value cannot be changed (for variables), a method cannot be overridden (for methods), or a class cannot be subclassed (for classes). ABSTRACT: Indicates that a class cannot be instantiated or that a method must be implemented in a subclass. SYNCRONIZED: Used in multi-threading to ensure that a method or block of code can only be accessed by one thread at a time. VOLATILE: Indicates that a variable may be changed unexpectedly, used mainly in multi-threading to ensure visibility. TRANSIENT: Prevents serialization of certain fields in a class, so they won’t be saved when an object is serialized. NATIVE: Indicates that a method is implemented in platform-dependent code (e.g., C/C++) rather than in Java. STRICTFP: Used to restrict floating-point calculations to ensure portability across platforms.</p> <p>3. CONTROL FLOW STATEMENTDS: Control flow keywords dictate the execution flow of the program. if: Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true. else: Executes a block of code if the condition in the if statement is false. SWITCH: A multi-way branch statement that allows for variable comparison against multiple cases. CASE: Defines a branch in a switch statement. DEFAULT: Specifies the default block of code in a switch statement if no case matches. BREAK: Exits a loop or switch statement. CONTINUE: Skips the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next iteration. RETURN: Exits a method and optionally returns a value. DO: Executes a block of code once before checking a condition. WHILE: Executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true. FOR: A loop that executes a block of code a specific number of times, typically used for iterating over arrays or collections. TRY: Defines a block of code to be tested for exceptions during execution. catch: Defines a block of code to handle exceptions thrown by the try block. FINALLY: Defines a block of code that will always execute after a try block, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or caught. throw: Used to explicitly throw an exception. THROWS: Declares that a method can throw one or more exceptions, informing callers that they must handle those exceptions.</p><p>4.

PACKAGE AND IMPORT KEYWORDS: Keywords for organizing and using classes.PACKAGE: Defines a namespace for a group of related classes. IMPORT: Allows the use of classes from other packages without specifying their fully qualified names.</p> <p>7. OTHER KEYWORDS: Miscellaneous keywords that serve specific purposes.
